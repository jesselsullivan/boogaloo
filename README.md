## Boogaloo

A common Libertarian meme to reference the overthrowing of a government or authoritarian force by a(n) (armed) revolution.

This can also be in regard to a societal revolution whereby the citizenry of the United States become aware of the reality of certain political topics, or are “ redpilled ”, rather than using their preconceived emotions to form an opinion on those specific political topics.

Also fun fact: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
